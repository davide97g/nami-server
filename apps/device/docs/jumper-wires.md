# Jumper Wires

## Overview
Jumper wires (also known as jumper cables or DuPont wires) are electrical wires with connector pins at each end, used to create temporary connections between components on a breadboard or between different parts of a circuit without soldering.

## Key Specifications

### Physical Characteristics
- **Wire Gauge**: Typically 26 AWG (American Wire Gauge)
- **Conductor**: Stranded copper wire (flexible)
- **Insulation**: PVC or similar flexible material
- **Length**: Various lengths available (common: 10cm, 20cm, 30cm)
- **Pin Spacing**: 2.54 mm (0.1 inch) - standard breadboard spacing
- **Colors**: Available in multiple colors for easy identification and organization

### Connector Types
Jumper wires come in three main configurations:

1. **Male-to-Male (M-M)**
   - Both ends have male pins
   - Used to connect two female headers or breadboard rows
   - Most common type for breadboard prototyping

2. **Male-to-Female (M-F)**
   - One end has a male pin, the other has a female socket
   - Used to connect male headers to female headers
   - Useful for connecting development boards to breadboards

3. **Female-to-Female (F-F)**
   - Both ends have female sockets
   - Used to connect two male headers
   - Less common, used for specific connection scenarios

### Electrical Characteristics
- **Voltage Rating**: Typically rated for low-voltage applications (up to 30V)
- **Current Rating**: Typically 1-3A depending on wire gauge
- **Resistance**: Low resistance (typically < 0.1Ω per meter)
- **Temperature Range**: -20°C to +80°C (typical)

### Color Coding
Common color schemes include:
- **Red**: Power/VCC (+)
- **Black**: Ground/GND (-)
- **Yellow/Green/Blue**: Signal lines
- **White/Orange/Purple**: Additional signal lines

Color coding helps organize circuits and reduces wiring errors.

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Power Connections**: Use red wires for VCC and black wires for GND
2. **Signal Lines**: Use different colors for different signals to avoid confusion
3. **Length**: Use appropriate length wires to avoid clutter
4. **Organization**: Keep wires organized and avoid crossing wires unnecessarily
5. **Inspection**: Check wires for damage before use

### Common Applications
- Breadboard prototyping
- Connecting sensors to microcontrollers
- Linking development boards to peripherals
- Testing and debugging circuits
- Educational electronics projects

### Compatibility
- Compatible with:
  - Standard breadboards (2.54mm spacing)
  - Arduino and compatible boards
  - ESP32 and other development boards
  - Raspberry Pi GPIO headers
  - Most 0.1" pitch headers

## Important Notes
- **Reusability**: Jumper wires are reusable but may wear out after many insertions
- **Contact Quality**: Ensure good contact by fully inserting wires
- **Current Limitations**: Not suitable for high-current applications (>3A)
- **Durability**: Stranded wire is flexible but can break if bent repeatedly
- **Storage**: Store in organized containers to prevent tangling

## Safety Considerations
- Always disconnect power before making or changing connections
- Check wire integrity before use
- Do not exceed voltage/current ratings
- Keep wires away from heat sources
- Avoid sharp bends that could damage the wire
